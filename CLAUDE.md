# How Safe Is AI? — Project Spec

## Overview

A daily-updated, interactive data visualization that tracks every known vulnerability (CVE) affecting AI systems. Vulnerabilities are presented as biological specimens growing in petri dishes — because vulnerabilities, like organisms, grow, spread, and evolve.

Hosted as a single page on GitHub Pages. React + D3.js frontend. GitHub Actions for daily data pipeline. No backend.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (with Vite), D3.js for organism simulations
- **Rendering:** SVG filters + HTML5 Canvas hybrid per petri dish
- **Data pipeline:** Python script run via GitHub Actions (daily at 00:00 UTC)
- **Data sources:** NVD API (api.nvd.nist.gov) + GitHub Advisory Database
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (static)
- **Styling:** CSS-in-JS or CSS modules, light theme

## Build Phases

Build in this exact order. Complete each phase before moving to the next.

### Phase 1: Scaffold
- Initialize React app with Vite
- Install dependencies: d3, react, react-dom
- Set up project structure as above
- Create categories.json config file
- Create sample data matching the JSON schema below
- Verify dev server runs

### Phase 2: Layout + Intro Section
- Build IntroSection with three beats:
  1. "Why this exists" — short paragraph
  2. "How to read the dishes" — visual guide explaining size, color, faded vs vivid
  3. Headline stats bar: Total CVEs · Critical · Exploited · Patch rate · QoQ trend
- Build LabBench as 3x3 CSS grid on cream/off-white background
- Build Footer with methodology and data source credits
- Page should be scrollable: intro visible on load, scroll down to reach the bench
- The bench background should have subtle lab texture: faint grain, slight warmth, soft shadows under dish positions

### Phase 3: Petri Dishes (2-3 unique + default)
- Build PetriDish component with SVG filter + Canvas hybrid rendering
- Each dish is a circular container with:
  - Glass rim effect (light gradient around edge, subtle shadow)
  - Tinted translucent agar base (color per category)
  - Organism colonies inside (driven by data)
- Build unique pattern algorithms for 2-3 dishes first:
  - Prompt Injection (radiating tendrils from center)
  - Supply Chain (scattered multi-colored colonies)
  - One more of your choice
- Build DefaultPattern.js as fallback for remaining 6 dishes (organic metaball blobs, works for any category)
- Data-to-visual mapping:
  - CVE count per product → colony blob SIZE
  - CVE severity → color INTENSITY (critical = vivid core, low = faint edge)
  - Number of products → number of distinct colonies
  - Actively exploited CVEs → pulsing bioluminescent glow
  - Patched CVEs → faded/desaturated colonies
  - Unpatched CVEs → vivid/bright colonies
- Animations: slow breathing pulse (~4s cycle), drifting speckle particles, critical CVE flash

### Phase 4: Lab Notes Panel
- On dish click: notes panel appears NEXT TO the clicked dish
- Other dishes fade/blur (CSS filter: blur + opacity reduction)
- Click outside or click dish again to dismiss
- Lab Notes content (4 sections):

#### Section 1: Header
```
SPECIMEN: [Category Name]
OBSERVED: [Last updated date]
```

#### Section 2: About This Specimen
2-3 sentence plain-English explainer. Jargon-free. Defined per category in categories.json.

#### Section 3: Why It Looks This Way
Explains the visual metaphor — why this dish has tendrils/splatter/rings/etc. Ties the pattern to how the attack actually works. Defined per category in categories.json.

#### Section 4: Observations (interactive)
- Total CVE count
- Severity breakdown as colored dots or bar
- QoQ trend with direction arrow
- Hovering a severity level in the notes → highlights corresponding zone in the dish:
  - Critical → core/center of dish glows
  - High → mid-ring area glows
  - Medium → outer area glows
  - Low → faint edges glow

#### Section 5: Treatment Status
- Patch rate as progress bar (e.g., "63% patched")
- Hovering "Patched" → highlights faded/desaturated areas in dish
- Hovering "Unpatched" → highlights vivid/bright areas in dish

### Phase 5: Polish
- Lab bench texture refinement (grain, subtle ruled markings along edges)
- Responsive design (works on desktop, degrades gracefully on tablet)
- Smooth transitions on dish focus/unfocus
- Scroll behavior: intro section visible on load, lab bench below
- Typography: use a serif or slab-serif for the intro (editorial feel), monospace for lab notes and data
- Performance: ensure 9 canvas animations run smoothly simultaneously

### Phase 6: Data Pipeline
- Create scripts/fetch-cves.py:
  1. Query NVD API with keyword groups (see Keyword Strategy below)
  2. Query GitHub Advisory DB GraphQL API
  3. Filter for relevance (score by AI-term density, discard low scores)
  4. Categorize using hybrid approach (keyword scan → product fallback → drop unmatched)
  5. Derive patch status from references/advisory data
  6. Compute summary stats, per-category stats, severity breakdowns, QoQ trends
  7. Output data/cves.json and data/stats.json
- Date range: 2024-01-01 onwards
- One category per CVE (no duplicates across dishes)
- Priority-ordered keyword matching determines category winner
- Create .github/workflows/update-data.yml:
  - Runs daily at 00:00 UTC
  - Runs the Python script
  - Commits updated JSON files to repo

### Phase 7: Deploy
- Configure Vite for GitHub Pages base path
- Set up GitHub Pages deployment (gh-pages branch or GitHub Actions deploy)
- Verify site loads at username.github.io/how-safe-is-ai

### Product → default category fallback

If no keyword matches, assign by product:

```
LangChain        → Agentic Autonomy
AutoGPT          → Agentic Autonomy
CrewAI           → Agentic Autonomy
TensorFlow       → Model Poisoning
PyTorch          → Model Poisoning
HuggingFace      → Supply Chain
MLflow           → Supply Chain
Ollama           → Data Leakage
OpenAI plugins   → Prompt Injection
ChromaDB         → Vector / Embedding
Pinecone         → Vector / Embedding
Weaviate         → Vector / Embedding
```

Unmatched CVEs are dropped entirely.

## Visual Design Spec

### Overall theme
- **Light theme** — warm off-white/cream background (#f5f2eb)
- **Lab bench aesthetic** — subtle grain texture, warmth, soft shadows
- **Colorful petri dishes** on the bench, inspired by real petri dish photography
- **Editorial typography** — serif/slab-serif for intro section, monospace for lab notes and data
- NOT a dark cyberpunk dashboard — this is bright, scientific, editorial

### Petri dish rendering (SVG + Canvas hybrid)

**SVG filter layer:**
- `feTurbulence` for agar grain texture
- `feDisplacementMap` for organic colony edge distortion
- `feGaussianBlur` for soft color bleeding
- `feColorMatrix` for per-dish color theming

**Canvas layer:**
- Colony blobs drawn with metaball-style algorithms
- Each dish has a unique drawing function (or uses DefaultPattern)
- Offscreen canvas composited into the dish

**Dish container:**
- Circular with glass rim effect (light gradient, subtle reflection arc)
- Drop shadow underneath
- Tinted translucent agar base

### Per-dish colors

| Dish | Agar tint | Colony colors |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt Injection | Pale pink | Hot pink → magenta, dark center |
| Improper Output Handling | Pale coral | Bright blue on red-orange |
| Model Poisoning | Pale yellow | Dark brown/amber, speckled |
| Data Leakage | Pale cream | Deep blue rings, yellow rim |
| Denial of Service | Pale green | Vivid green + blue, dense |
| Supply Chain | Dark/black | Multi-colored scattered |
| Model Theft | Pale teal | Deep teal, white veins |
| Agentic Autonomy | Pale amber | Orange-yellow clusters |
| Vector / Embedding | Pale green | Green lace/web patterns |

### Per-dish unique patterns

| Dish | Algorithm |
|---|---|
| Prompt Injection | Central blob + radiating tendrils via random-walk paths, forking 1-2 times. Tendril count scales with CVE count. |
| Improper Output Handling | Random splatter — blobs at random positions with random sizes. SVG displacement for organic edges. |
| Model Poisoning | Dense central mass (overlapping metaballs). Ring of dark speckle dots at edges (Perlin noise). |
| Data Leakage | Concentric noise-distorted rings radiating outward. Ring count = severity levels with CVEs. |
| Denial of Service | Aggressive growth from multiple seed points. Blobs expand and merge to nearly fill dish. |
| Supply Chain | Poisson disc sampled colonies, each a different product/color. Colony size = CVE count per product. |
| Model Theft | Single colony with L-system branching veins toward edges. Branch count = CVE count. White veins on dark colony. |
| Agentic Autonomy | Central blob cluster + satellite blobs at distance with faint connection trails. Satellite count = product count. |
| Vector / Embedding | Force-layout nodes connected by thin organic lines. Node size = CVE count per product. Lines get SVG blur. |

For v1: Build 2-3 unique patterns. Use DefaultPattern (organic metaball blobs) for the rest.

### Animations
- Colonies breathe slowly (scale pulse, ~4 second cycle)
- Tiny speckle particles drift across agar surface
- Critical/exploited CVEs flash with bioluminescent pulse
- Patched colonies are faded/desaturated; unpatched are vivid

### Data-to-visual mapping

| Data | Visual |
|---|---|
| CVE count per product | Colony blob size |
| CVE severity | Color intensity (critical = vivid core, low = faint edge) |
| Number of products | Number of distinct colonies |
| Actively exploited | Pulsing glow |
| Patched | Faded/desaturated |
| Unpatched | Vivid/bright |
| QoQ trend growing | Colonies spread toward edges |
| QoQ trend shrinking | Colonies pull toward center |

### Severity → spatial zones in dish
- Critical → center/core
- High → mid-ring
- Medium → outer ring
- Low → faint edges

This mapping is used for the hover-highlight interaction in Lab Notes.

---

## Interaction Summary

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Idle | Colonies breathe, particles drift, ambient glow |
| Hover dish | Dish brightens, category name + CVE count tooltip |
| Click dish | Lab notes appear next to dish, other dishes fade/blur |
| Hover severity in notes | Corresponding zone in dish highlights |
| Hover "Patched" in notes | Faded areas highlight |
| Hover "Unpatched" in notes | Vivid areas highlight |
| Click outside / click dish again | Notes dismiss, all dishes return to normal |

---

## Important Notes

- Categories are CONFIG-DRIVEN via categories.json. The grid renders dynamically based on however many categories exist. Always fills rows of 3, last row centers if incomplete.
- For v1, use SAMPLE DATA to nail the visual design. Wire up the real data pipeline in Phase 6.
- The project must work as a static site on GitHub Pages — no server-side rendering, no API calls at runtime (frontend just reads committed JSON files).
- Performance matters — 9 simultaneous canvas animations must run smoothly. Use requestAnimationFrame, offscreen canvases, and throttle where needed.
